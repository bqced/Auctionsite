## What it does
The web app allows user to list items on the website so other users can make biddings on it and it also allows users to make biddings on the listed items. 

## How to run
The project is set up in a python package approach. A package is a directory with Python files and a file with the name __init__.py. This means that every directory inside the Python path, which contains a file named __init__.py, will be treated as a package by Python.
